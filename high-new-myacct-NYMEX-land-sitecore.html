<h2 id="WhatAreNYMEX">What are Energy Market Alerts?</h2>
<p>Energy commodities are traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and "Energy Market Alerts" (formerly known as "NYMEX Alerts") available on the <a href="http://myaccount.directenergy.com" target="_blank">My Account</a> portal of <a href="http://www.business.directenergy.com" target="_blank">www.business.directenergy.com</a> will allow customers to monitor price movements in Henry Hub natural gas along with several regional power indices and be alerted when the commodity price rises above or falls below specified levels. Energy Market Alerts are a valuable tool for customers who want to track commodity price trends in a time efficient manner. When a Energy Market Alert is set and if a market price exceeds the high set price or goes below the low set price, customers will receive emails and messages in the My Account Message Center. Energy Market Alerts can be used to notify customers of changes in market trends or risks or opportunities in the execution of their risk management plan.</p>
<h2 id="CreateNYMEX">Creating new Energy Market Alerts</h2>
<p>After logging in to My Account, a customer can find the Energy Market Alerts they have created in the Energy Market Alerts section in Preferences. Above the list of currently active Energy Market alerts, a customer can then select <strong>New Alert</strong> to monitor a new energy market.</p>
<div style="clear: left; display: inline-block; margin-top: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; border: 1px solid #dbdbdb; border-radius: 4px;"><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; width: 800px; height: 451px;" alt="My Account Energy Market preferences" src="~/media/A2BB7209FB6644C4A420CBDC1568B0C9.ashx?la=en&amp;h=451&amp;w=800" title="My Account Energy Market preferences" />
  <p>Users can create as many Energy Market Alerts as they wish. Multiple alerts can be created for the same energy market or delivery date.</p>
</div>
<p>There are 3 types of alerts which can be created in My Account: monthly, strip price and weighted average strip. The process of creating and editing all of these types of alerts is similar, but there are important differences.</p>
<p>After selecting to create a new alert, enter a unique name for your alert. Once you select an energy market, the available alert types will be shown. For power energy markets, monthly and strip price alerts are available. For the natural gas energy market, monthly, strip price and weighted average strip alerts are available.</p>
<div style="clear: left; display: inline-block; margin-top: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; border: 1px solid #dbdbdb; border-radius: 4px;"><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%;" alt="My Account alert types" src="file:///C|/Users/gminnaert/Desktop/sitecore-myact-upates/deb-img-myact-nymex-alert-types.png" title="My Account Energy Market preferences" />
</div>

<h2 id="CreateNYMEXmonthly">Monthly Alerts</h2>
<p>When creating or editing a monthly energy market alert, a single delivery month is available to be selected. There are up to four years of delivery months available. Once you select a delivery month, the most recent market price for that delivery month is shown below. </p>
<h2 id="CreateNYMEXstrip">Strip Price Alerts</h2>
<p>A strip price is the average of a sequential series of monthly futures contracts, and can be a good indicator of where energy commodity prices are for those months.</p>
<h2 id="CreateNYMEXweightedstrip">Strip and Weighted Average Strip Alerts</h2>
<p>A strip price is the average of a sequential series of monthly futures contracts, and can be a good indicator of where energy commodity prices are for those months. Weighted average strip pricing uses the same average of monthly futures contracts, but also allocates different weights to the various prices included.</p>
<p>Some customers may find these pricing averages helpful as a part of their risk management plan. My Account supports creating Energy Market Alerts for a single month, but not multiple months. In order to have equivalents to strip and weighted average strip pricing, users can create separate sequential alerts for each month in which you want to monitor pricing. The ability to create strip pricing alerts was available in previous versions of the portal, but will not be available in the new My Account.</p>
<p>The "weight" in the weighted average strip alert is the monthly volume.</p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt; background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">Enter estimated volume for each month to create a weighted average. Contracted volumes from all of your accounts can optionally be displayed in the volume column below and can be edited. Populate volume column with available contracted values </p>
<p>The first step is to name the alert, choose an energy market (formerly this was labeled "commodity") and choose a delivery date up to four years in the future.</p>
<div style="clear: left; display: inline-block; margin-top: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; border: 1px solid #dbdbdb; border-radius: 4px;"><img width="497" height="461" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; height: 461px; width: 497px;" alt="My Account Energy Market alert commodity selection" src="~/media/F811816DBCFA4291893753DB9774052F.ashx?la=en&amp;h=461&amp;w=497" title="My Account Energy Market alert commodity selection" />
<p>There are many energy markets available to create alerts for. Natural Gas has a single energy market to monitor, whereas the power markets are regional.</p>
</div>
<p>Once the energy market and delivery date are selected, the most recent market price is displayed (please note that the price feed utilizes delayed quotes and will show the "last traded price" which could be as recent as 20-30 minutes old or date back to the prior day's closing price - depending on the commodity, time of day and delivery month). Next, high and low values must be entered. My Account will only allow high values that are above the displayed market price and the low values that are below the market price. To complete the process, save the alert.</p>
<p>My Account will only allow high values that are above the displayed market price and the low values that are below the market price. The most recently market price is displayed, based on the selected commodity and delivery date above the high and low values.

<p>When creating or editing a Energy Market alert, the high and low values are validated to ensure appropriate values are entered.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="WorkingNYMEX">Working With Your Active Energy Market Alerts</h2>
<p>The Energy Market Alerts section in Preferences displays the alerts the user has created. Active alerts are those that have not reached the Delivery date (expiration of the specified NYMEX futures contract). Once the delivery date has been reached, an alert becomes expired. Expired Energy Market alerts are listed in the Expired Energy Market Alerts lists. </p>
<p>From the Active Energy Market alerts section, you can edit or delete any alert you have created.</p>
<div style="clear: left; display: inline-block; margin-top: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; border: 1px solid #dbdbdb; border-radius: 4px;"><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; width: 100%; height: 100%;" alt="My Account Energy Market active alert list" src="~/media/6D7B22E448F6444E83CD3833FEB247C8.ashx?la=en&amp;h=100%25&amp;w=100%25" title="My Account Energy Market active alert list" />
<p>Active Energy Market Alerts can be edited and deleted. Expired Energy Market alerts can be deleted, but not edited.</p>
</div>
<p>The Active Energy Market Alerts section displays the alerts you have created which have not reached their delivery date (expiration of the specified NYMEX futures contract). These active alerts will generate messages and emails when their thresholds are met. Once the delivery date has been reached, the "Expired Energy Market Alerts" section will be displayed.</p>
<p>Energy market alerts are individual to each user in My Account.&nbsp; When an Energy Market Alert is set and if a market price exceeds the high set price or goes below the low set price, the alert messages will be sent to the single email address for the user who created the alert. If you have other members on your team who have access to your Direct Energy accounts, they will need to create their own alerts.</p>
<h2 id="EditNYMEX">Editing Active Alerts</h2>
<p>Any value of a Energy Market alert can be edited. After the changes are saved, the alert will use the updated information to generate alerts. An email and message will be sent to the user with the details of the edited values of the alert.</p>
<div style="clear: left; display: inline-block; margin-top: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; border: 1px solid #dbdbdb; border-radius: 4px;"><img width="555" height="667" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%;" alt="My Account Energy Market edit alert" src="~/media/4DE66A597AE34232BE8CB0B7D4693206.ashx?la=en" title="My Account Energy Market edit alert" />
<p>Any value of an alert can be edited. The same rules for ensuring valid values are entered are still enforced when editing an alert.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="EmailNYMEX">Energy Market Alert Emails</h2>
<p>When a Energy Market Alert is set and if a market price exceeds the high set price or goes below the low set price, customers will receive an email from My Account.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="MessageEnergyMarket">Energy Market Alert Message Center</h2>
<p>When a Energy Market Alert is set and if a market price exceeds the high set price or goes below the low set price, My Account users will receive emails and messages in the Message Center.
